==============

The origin of Bitcask is tied to the history of the Riak distributed database. In a Riak key/value 
cluster, each node uses pluggable local storage; nearly anything k/v-shaped can be used as the 
per-host storage engine. This pluggability allowed progress on Riak to be parallelized such that 
storage engines could be improved and tested without impact on the rest of the codebase.
